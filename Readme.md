# PlayTube üé¨

PlayTube is a video library application designed to replicate the core experience of a modern video-sharing platform. It serves as a go-to destination for discovering and enjoying a vast collection of videos. The application allows users to browse a curated feed, search for specific content, watch videos in a dedicated player, and manage a personal "Watch Later" list.

This project was built from the ground up using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on mastering fundamental web development concepts without relying on frameworks or libraries. It demonstrates key front-end skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous JavaScript for data fetching, and managing application state locally.

## ‚ú® Features In-Depth

* **Dynamic Video Feed**: The homepage greets users with a dynamic list of available videos. This feed is generated by fetching video metadata from a local JSON file, simulating a call to a real-world API endpoint.
* **Live Search Functionality**: Users can instantly find videos using the search bar. The search function filters the video list in real-time as the user types, providing a seamless and responsive user experience by matching the input against video titles.
* **Dedicated Video Player**: Clicking on any video thumbnail navigates the user to a separate, clean player page. This page dynamically loads the selected video and its details (title, description, etc.) by passing the video's unique ID through URL parameters, ensuring a focused viewing experience.
* **Persistent "Watch Later" Playlist**: Users can bookmark videos to watch later. This functionality uses the browser's `localStorage` to persist the playlist, meaning the user's saved videos will be remembered even after they close the browser tab. The "Add/Remove" button provides clear feedback on the video's status.
* **Watch Later Management Page**: A dedicated page displays all the videos a user has saved. From here, users can easily view their playlist and remove videos they've already watched or are no longer interested in.
* **Fully Responsive Design**: The application is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a clean and intuitive layout that gracefully adapts to all screen sizes. It provides an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones alike.



## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Rationale

* **HTML5**: Semantic HTML is used to provide structure and accessibility, ensuring the application is well-organized and understood by both browsers and assistive technologies.
* **CSS3**: Modern CSS, including Flexbox and Grid, is used to create a sophisticated and fully responsive layout. The styling is designed to be clean, modern, and intuitive.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: All interactive logic is powered by vanilla JavaScript. This choice was made deliberately to demonstrate a strong understanding of core language features, including:
    * The Fetch API for asynchronous data loading.
    * DOM manipulation to dynamically render content.
    * Event listeners to handle user interactions.
    * `localStorage` for client-side storage.
    * URLSearchParams to manage state across pages.

## üèõÔ∏è Application Architecture

The application is architected as a multi-page application (MPA) with distinct roles for each file, simulating a classic web application structure.

1.  **`index.html` / `script.js`**: This is the main entry point. `script.js` fetches the entire video collection from `data.json` and dynamically renders the video list on the page. It also contains the logic for the live search feature.
2.  **Passing Data**: When a user clicks on a video, its unique ID is appended to the URL as a query parameter (e.g., `video.html?id=1`).
3.  **`video.html` / `video.js`**: The `video.js` script on this page reads the `id` from the URL, finds the corresponding video object from the fetched data, and populates the page with the video's details. It also handles the logic for adding or removing that video from the "Watch Later" list in `localStorage`.
4.  **`watch-later.html` / `watch-later.js`**: This page's script begins by retrieving the list of saved video IDs from `localStorage`. It then fetches the `data.json` file and filters it to get the details of only the saved videos, which are then rendered on the page.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a modern web browser and a code editor of your choice.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TANiSH-17/PlayTube.git](https://github.com/TANiSH-17/PlayTube.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd PlayTube
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    * You can open `index.html` directly in your browser.
    * **Recommended:** For the best experience, run the project using a live server extension (like "Live Server" for VS Code). The application uses the `fetch()` API to load `data.json`. Some browsers enforce security policies (CORS) that can block these requests when opening files directly from the local filesystem (`file:///...`). A live server avoids this by serving the files over a local network address (`http://localhost:...`).

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* **Backend Integration**: Transition from a local `data.json` file to a full-fledged backend with a REST API built using Node.js/Express and a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
* **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts to allow each user to have their own distinct "Watch Later" playlist.
* **API Integration**: Fetch video data from a real-world service like the YouTube Data API.
* **Advanced State Management**: For a larger application, introduce a more robust state management pattern to handle data across the application more efficiently.
* **UI Enhancements**: Add CSS animations, loading spinners for data fetching, and toast notifications for user actions (e.g., "Video added to Watch Later").
